**Q:Interview**

Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are .

Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds  screening contest.

**Answer**

SELECT con.contest_id, con.hacker_id, con.name, SUM(sg.total_submissions), SUM(sg.total_accepted_submissions), SUM(vg.total_views), SUM(vg.total_unique_views) FROM Contests AS con JOIN Colleges AS col ON con.contest_id = col.contest_id JOIN Challenges AS cha ON cha.college_id = col.college_id LEFT JOIN (SELECT ss.challenge_id, SUM(ss.total_submissions) AS total_submissions, SUM(ss.total_accepted_submissions) AS total_accepted_submissions FROM  Submission_Stats AS ss GROUP BY ss.challenge_id) AS sg ON cha.challenge_id = sg.challenge_id LEFT JOIN (SELECT vs.challenge_id, SUM(vs.total_views) AS total_views, SUM(total_unique_views) AS total_unique_views FROM View_Stats AS vs GROUP BY vs.challenge_id) AS vg ON cha.challenge_id = vg.challenge_id GROUP BY con.contest_id, con.hacker_id, con.name HAVING SUM(sg.total_submissions)+       SUM(sg.total_accepted_submissions)+       SUM(vg.total_views)+       SUM(vg.total_unique_views) > 0 ORDER BY con.contest_id;

**Q:Content Leadership**

You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

**Answer**

SELECT con.contest_id, con.hacker_id, con.name, SUM(sg.total_submissions), SUM(sg.total_accepted_submissions),
SUM(vg.total_views), SUM(vg.total_unique_views) FROM Contests AS con JOIN Colleges AS col ON con.contest_id = col.contest_id
JOIN Challenges AS cha ON cha.college_id = col.college_id LEFT JOIN (SELECT ss.challenge_id, SUM(ss.total_submissions) AS total_submissions, SUM(ss.total_accepted_submissions) AS total_accepted_submissions FROM Submission_Stats AS ss GROUP BY ss.challenge_id) AS sg ON cha.challenge_id = sg.challenge_id LEFT JOIN (SELECT vs.challenge_id, SUM(vs.total_views) AS total_views, SUM(total_unique_views) AS total_unique_views FROM View_Stats AS vs GROUP BY vs.challenge_id) AS vg ON cha.challenge_id = vg.challenge_id GROUP BY con.contest_id, con.hacker_id, con.name HAVING SUM(sg.total_submissions)+  SUM(sg.total_accepted_submissions)+ SUM(vg.total_views)+ SUM(vg.total_unique_views) > 0 ORDER BY con.contest_id;


**Q:Symmetric-Pairs**

You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.

Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

**Answer**

SELECT f1.X, f1.Y FROM Functions AS f1 WHERE f1.X = f1.Y AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Functions WHERE X = f1.X AND Y = f1.Y) > 1 UNION SELECT f1.X, f1.Y from Functions AS f1 WHERE EXISTS(SELECT X, Y FROM Functions WHERE f1.X = Y AND f1.Y = X AND f1.X < X) ORDER BY X;

**Q:Population**

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

**Answer**
select
    Doctor,
    Professor,
    Singer,
    Actor
from (
    select
        NameOrder,
        max(case Occupation when 'Doctor' then Name end) as Doctor,
        max(case Occupation when 'Professor' then Name end) as Professor,
        max(case Occupation when 'Singer' then Name end) as Singer,
        max(case Occupation when 'Actor' then Name end) as Actor
    from (
            select
                Occupation,
                Name,
                row_number() over(partition by Occupation order by Name ASC) as NameOrder
            from Occupations
         ) as NameLists
    group by NameOrder
    ) as Names

**Q:Binary Tree**

You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

**Answer**

SELECT N, IF(P IS NULL,"Root",IF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BST WHERE P=B.N)>0,"Inner","Leaf")) FROM BST AS B ORDER BY N;

**Q:The Pads**

Generate the following two result sets:
Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

**Answer**

SELECT concat(NAME,concat("(",LEFT(occupation,1),")")) 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY NAME ASC;

select CONCAT("There are a total of", " ",COUNT(occupation), " ",LCASE(occupation),"s",".")AS stat from OCCUPATIONS group by occupation order by COUNT(occupation) ASC,occupation
